From 1 July 2011 Write Anything can now be found at our new home–http://wa.emergent-publishing.com.

Come join us for new content, new writers and a new look, with the same enthusiasm and passion for the craft of writing.

This site is now closed, but the content will remain online as an archive.

Thank you to all our readers, to all our friends from over the past five years.

See you on the new site!

Paul Anderson
Managing Editor–Write Anything
